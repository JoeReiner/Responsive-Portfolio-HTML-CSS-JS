              <h2>About the Project</h2>
              <p>After spending 8 years in a variety of public school settings, it was often a challenge to simply communicate between staff during a busy school day. I wanted to finally add something to my portfolio that was rooted in solving a real problem that teachers face daily. I luckily was not alone for this process!</p>
              <br>
            </div>
            
            <div class="case-study-content">
              <h2>Timeline & Team</h2>
              <p>My 2 classmates, Gabby (left) and Ali (right), joined me after a brief project pitch to the class, and we quickly began the design process for this tool, ranging from UX Research to User Interface Design to Front-End Development. We had 3 weeks for the full design process from start to finish that involved UX and UI designers that were learning the front-end process.</p>

              <h2>My Role</h2>

            <div class="case-study-content">
              <h2>The Scenario</h2>
              <p>Imagine that you're a teacher in a public middle school and you serve 135 students over a 7 period school-day. This schedule involves 8 different passing-times with hundreds of students moving between rooms, floors, and hallways over a 6 minute window. <br>
                <img src="Images/hallway.png" alt="busy hallway" class="center">
                As a staff member, you are required to be present in the hallway to supervise and assist with the flow of students. As your classroom fills with students for the next hour ahead, you cannot be present at your district-issued desktop computer during these times, so getting critical student and school information is often diffcult. <br><br> 
                Your leadership team and general staff relay information in a vartiety of ways. Many methods are used ranging from walkie-talkies to Email, Team chat, or simply just chatting in-person. You begin to miss out on key information. You feel lacking for students who are in crisis at times, and you know the tools are there for immediate messaging, yet you can't rally your staff to communicate with consistency. Here is where <i>Class Track</i> comes into play.</p><br>
              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <p>Most public school teachers have too many ways to receive and send information during a school day. A typical day is very busy with many moving parts, so information is needed quickly and accuratley. What tools staff choose to use depends on a lot, and a lack of consistency leads to lapses in daily communication. This issue is where our team began researching with crafting one central tool that school staff can utilize on mobile or desktop, with any device. The tool, <i>Class Track</i>, allows staff to relay messages about students, meetings, incidents, and anything that helps keep the day-to-day flow of school moving smoothly.</p>

            <div class="case-study-content">
              <h2>The Solution</h2>
              <p>Class Track allows staff to relay messages about students, meetings, incidents, and anything that helps keep the day-to-day flow of school moving smoothly. This app was designed with teachers and administrators in mind to utilize mobily with phones, yet also offered for desktop use. Simple and efficient, staff can feel connected for whatever the schoolday brings.</p>

              <h2>The Result & What We Learned</h2>
              <p>Through the design process, we were able to refine our idea to a few much needed features; creating an alert and viewing alerts made by others. Users confirmed throughout testing how needed a tool like this is in a busy school environment. <br>

                <br><h3>Ideas we would like to add:</h3>

              
                  <li>Adding functionality to the attendance and gradebook screens</li>
                  <li>Additional features like a chat/messaging tool for teachers to quickly get in touch with each other on their phones</li>
                  <li>Offer a variety of symbols/scenarios for school systems to utilize based on their setting’s needs</li>

                <br><h3>Future Considerations:</h3>

                  <li>A tablet version as tablets are a common tool used in school.</li>
                  <li>Syncing and integration potential of the variety of teacher tools in use with this app.</li>
                

                <br><h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>

                <li>Spend significant time preparing your UX research to save yourself difficulties in the long run.</li>
                <li>Try not to complicate the front end process and stick to just a few languages.</li>
                <li>This was a fulfilling experience to create a tool that teachers can see fitting into their lives with the purpose we intended.</li>
