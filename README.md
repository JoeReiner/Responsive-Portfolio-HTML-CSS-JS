# Responsive-Portfolio-HTML-CSS-JS
A complete upgrade and overhaul to my original portfolio to include responsiveness, JavaScript, better imagery/text, &amp; a 4 new case studies!

This portfolio is comprised of a variety of resources, primarily coming from a few YouTube portfolio-tutorials to help me get a coding framework setup. It is essentially my first fully-coded project on my own that has taught me nearly everything about coding, syntax, and front-end web development.
